      <div class="room-description">
        You have entered a mysterious library filled with secrets and ancient knowledge.
        The air is thick with the scent of old paper and dust. Shelves tower above you,
        filled with books that seem to whisper as you pass by.
        <br><br>
        In the dim light, you notice strange symbols etched into the woodwork and peculiar
        artifacts scattered throughout the room.
        <br><br>
        To escape, you must solve the puzzles hidden within the library's walls before time runs out.
